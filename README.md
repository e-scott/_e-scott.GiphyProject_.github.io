# _e-scott.GiphyProject_.github.io

The Goal of this project was to create a page that makes an AJAX call to Giphy and displays gifs. There would be buttons that would be the topic of the Gif. Also there should be a search function that will add a Gif categorie or send an alert saying that there are no Gifs for that choice. Once a button is hit the Gifs should be still images until clicked.

This was a fun project that helped me to get a better grasp on how AJAX calls are made.
